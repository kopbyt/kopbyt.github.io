<h6> Rose Hack 2021: Project Submission</h6>

<h2> In today's society, there are not enough recognized women in mathematics when significant cotributions have been made. This website is to recognize women in mathematics and allow you to navigate through the different fields of mathematics! Enjoy &#128151</h2>
<h3> The field of pure mathematics and applied mathematics have slight differences. In the field of pure mathematics, mathematicians study and do math for the sake of doing math. On the other side, applied mathematicians find a way to apply math that has been proven and find ways to use it in everyday life. Both are important as pure mathematics paves the way to finding applications of math, and applied mathematics implemts those applications in math. Mathematics is a field that, with perserverence and asking questions, one can do well. If you find yourself interested in math and identify as a woman, please let this motivate and empower you to pursue your field. If you are interested in learning about the accomplishments of women in mathematics, you are in the right place. </h3>
